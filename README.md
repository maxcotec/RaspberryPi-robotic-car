# RaspberryPi-robotic-car
A self driving and collision avoidance autonomous car based on Raspberry Pi. This repository contains two versions of this project.

## 1. Manuall IP Controlled Robotic Car:
As the name says, we can simply control the robot with PC keyboard. The communication is done over UDP with JSON packets structure.

## 2. Fully Autonomous Robotic Car: 
This code is integrated with GPS, Compass Module (I2C communication) and Ultrasonic Sensors.
We provide the destination points to the Robot via PC through UDP communication and it then drive its way to that point by avoiding any objects on its way.
The GUI provides 3 different positions to make the robot move and also have dedicated Start and Stop buttons. 
The Manual Controls access can also be done. 
To test the code and make it work with your own robot, follow the steps included in the readme of that folder.
